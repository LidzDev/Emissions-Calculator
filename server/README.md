**Co2 EMISSIONS CALCULATOR**
**TITLE**
A Co2 emmisions calculator that is capable of displaying the total Co2 output of a companies employee commutes.

**DESCRIPTION**
We've been approached by an environmental sustainability consulting firm with a mission to help businesses minimise their carbon footprint. The challenge is to create a user-friendly application that computes a company's carbon emissions, primarily based on employee travel.
This project will not only assist businesses in understanding their environmental impact but also encourage sustainable choices in travel and help protect the planet.
